I want a comprehensive research review of computer vision in **2022**, structured as follows:

1. **Field Shifts and Trends**    
    - What were the dominant research themes and hot problems in 2022?
    - Did any paradigm shifts occur (architectures, training strategies, evaluation focus)?
2. **Seminal Papers**
    - List 8–12 of the most influential papers published in 2022.
    - For each:
        - Title, venue, link (arXiv if available).
        - Problem addressed and why it mattered.
        - Core idea/architecture/technical innovation.
        - Impact: benchmark improvements, real-world adoption, or opening new directions.
3. **Datasets and Benchmarks**
    - Which new datasets or challenges were introduced in 2022?
    - How did they influence progress or expose prior limitations?
4. **Industry and Application Impact**
    - Which research ideas from 2022 saw rapid uptake in products (e.g., generative models in creative tools, transformers in detection/segmentation)?
    - Were there visible shifts in self-driving, AR/VR, robotics, healthcare, etc.?
5. **Technical Innovations**
    - Break down notable technical levers:
        - Architectures (CNNs, transformers, diffusion, hybrids).
        - Training strategies (self-supervised, multi-modal, large-scale pretraining).
        - Efficiency techniques (quantization, distillation, sparsity, new hardware usage).
6. **Research Culture and Collaboration**
    - Were there new workshops, competitions, or cross-disciplinary movements that shaped the year?
    - Which institutions, labs, or regions were most prominent?
7. **Retrospective Relevance**
    - Which 2022 contributions remain central in 2025 (architectures, datasets, methods)?
    - Which ones faded quickly or were superseded?
8. **Meta Reflection**
    - What overall “research mindset” characterized 2022 (scaling laws, multimodality, generative explosion)?
    - What role did compute and hardware availability play?
    - Any lessons of over-hype or surprising under-currents?
Present the answer in a structured, year-in-review format. Include paper links where possible and highlight connections between different works.
