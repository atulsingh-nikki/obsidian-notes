# Summary
Generative Adversarial Networks introduced an **adversarial training framework** where two neural networks — a **Generator** and a **Discriminator** — compete in a minimax game. The generator learns to produce realistic samples from noise, while the discriminator learns to distinguish real from fake. GANs opened a new era of generative modeling, powering advances in **content creation, data augmentation, fashion, and art**.

# Key Idea (one-liner)
> Train a generator and discriminator in a two-player minimax game, where the generator fools the discriminator, and the discriminator pushes back.

# Method
- **Generator (G)**: maps random noise vector (z) to data space (e.g., images).
- **Discriminator (D)**: binary classifier, outputs probability sample is real.
- **Objective function**: minimax game

  \[
  \min_G \max_D V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_\text{data}} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z} [\log(1 - D(G(z)))]
  \]

- **Training**: alternating gradient updates for G and D.
- **Mode collapse**: common pathology where generator produces limited diversity.

# Results
- Showed first convincing **neural network-based generative model** producing sharp samples (MNIST digits).
- Sparked an explosion of GAN variants (DCGAN, WGAN, StyleGAN).
- Positioned adversarial training as a new paradigm in generative modeling.

# Why it Mattered
- Introduced **adversarial training** → core idea reused across ML (adversarial robustness, RL, diffusion).
- Demonstrated **neural networks can learn to generate** realistic, high-dimensional samples.
- Enabled downstream uses: data augmentation, content generation, art, super-resolution.

# Architectural Pattern
- [[Generator Network]] → neural network mapping noise → data.
- [[Discriminator Network]] → binary classifier for real vs fake.
- [[Adversarial Training]] → minimax optimization between networks.

# Connections
- **Predecessor**: [[Variational Autoencoders (2013)]] → probabilistic generative model.
- **Successors**: [[DCGAN (2015)]] → stabilized GAN training with convnets, [[WGAN (2017)]] → Wasserstein distance for stable optimization, [[StyleGAN (2018)]] → high-quality image synthesis.
- **Alternatives**: [[Diffusion Models]] (2020+) → overtook GANs in stability & fidelity.
- **Applications**: Content creation, [[Data Augmentation]], synthetic datasets, art, fashion.

# Implementation Notes
- Sensitive training (instability, mode collapse).
- Early GANs trained on MNIST; later adapted to high-resolution image datasets.
- Requires careful balance between G and D learning rates.

# Critiques / Limitations
- Training instability (non-convergence, mode collapse).
- Lack of likelihood estimation (unlike VAEs).
- Difficult to evaluate → FID/IS introduced later.

# Repro / Resources
- Paper: [arXiv:1406.2661](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
- Code: PyTorch/TensorFlow implementations widely available.
- Benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN.
