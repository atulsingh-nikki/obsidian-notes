# Summary
**Score-CAM (Wang et al., CVPRW 2019)** proposed a **gradient-free alternative to Grad-CAM**, addressing its instability from gradient saturation and noise. Instead of using gradients, Score-CAM weights activation maps based on their **class score contributions**, producing cleaner, more reliable heatmaps.

# Key Idea
> Remove dependency on noisy gradients by weighting each feature map with its **forward-passed class score impact**, leading to **robust and faithful visual explanations**.

# Method
- Extract activation maps from a chosen convolutional layer.  
- Mask input image with each activation map.  
- Forward pass masked images → measure change in target class score.  
- Use score differences as weights for feature maps.  
- Combine weighted maps → produce heatmap.  

# Results
- Produced sharper, less noisy explanations than Grad-CAM.  
- Better highlighted true discriminative regions.  
- More robust across architectures and datasets.  

# Why it Mattered
- Eliminated reliance on gradients (noisy, saturating).  
- Improved faithfulness and stability of saliency maps.  
- Sparked follow-ups (Ablation-CAM, Faster Score-CAM).  

# Architectural Pattern
- Forward-based weighting of feature maps → heatmap.  
- Gradient-free interpretability pipeline.  

# Connections
- Successor to **Grad-CAM (2017)**.  
- Related to **Ablation-CAM (2020)** (dropout-based variant).  
- Predecessor to transformer-native attribution methods.  

# Implementation Notes
- Requires multiple forward passes (one per feature map).  
- Computationally heavier than Grad-CAM.  
- Works out-of-the-box on pretrained CNNs.  

# Critiques / Limitations
- Expensive: requires many forward passes for deep networks.  
- Can still blur fine-grained details at low-resolution layers.  
- Less practical for real-time interpretability.

# Educational Connections

## Undergraduate-Level Concepts
- CAM = highlight “where the network is looking.”  
- Grad-CAM uses gradients (sometimes noisy).  
- Score-CAM uses forward predictions (class scores) → more stable.  

## Postgraduate-Level Concepts
- Saliency map generation via forward masking.  
- Trade-off: gradient-free (stable) vs computationally heavy.  
- Extensions: Ablation-CAM, Faster Score-CAM for efficiency.  
- Broader theme: attribution methods across modalities (vision, NLP).  

---

# My Notes
- Score-CAM = **fixing Grad-CAM’s gradient problem**.  
- Cleaner maps, but heavy compute cost.  
- Open question: Can attribution methods unify across CNNs and transformers (e.g., attention rollout)?  
- Possible extension: Score-CAM for multimodal (e.g., CLIP, VQA).
