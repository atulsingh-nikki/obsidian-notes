# Summary
AlexNet marked the **deep learning breakthrough** in computer vision by winning the ILSVRC 2012 challenge with a **massive margin** (15.3% top-5 error vs 26.2% for the next best). It demonstrated that large datasets (ImageNet) + GPUs + deep convolutional nets can vastly outperform traditional hand-engineered vision pipelines.

# Key Idea (one-liner)
> Deep CNNs, trained on GPUs with ReLU activations, dropout, and data augmentation, can crush traditional computer vision baselines.

# Method
- **Architecture**: 8 layers total (5 convolutional + 3 fully connected).
- **Novel ingredients at the time:**
  - **ReLU activations**: non-saturating → faster training vs sigmoid/tanh.
  - **GPU training**: 2 GTX 580s split the network, making large-scale training feasible.
  - **Dropout**: regularization to reduce overfitting in fully connected layers.
  - **Data augmentation**: image translations, reflections, PCA-based RGB intensity shifts.
  - **Local Response Normalization (LRN)**: inspired by lateral inhibition in biology.
- **Training**: SGD with momentum; large batch sizes; learning rate schedule adjusted manually.

# Results
- **ILSVRC 2012 Winner** with 15.3% top-5 error (vs 26.2% second best).
- Demonstrated scalability: 60 million parameters, 650,000 neurons.
- Sparked the deep learning revolution in vision and beyond.

# Why it Mattered
- First proof that **deep learning + GPUs + big data** could radically outperform classic pipelines.
- Made **ReLU**, **dropout**, and **data augmentation** mainstream.
- Triggered an explosion of deep learning research (CNNs, RNNs, later Transformers).
- Showed importance of **hardware acceleration** in AI progress.

# Architectural Pattern
- [[ReLU Activation]] → enabled faster convergence.
- [[Dropout]] → regularization technique for large FC layers.
- [[Local Response Normalization]] → precursor to BatchNorm (later replaced).
- [[GPU Acceleration in Deep Learning]] → practical necessity for scaling.

# Connections
- **Influence:** Inspired [[Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition|VGGNet (2014)]] (deeper, uniform design).
- **Contrast:** [[GoogLeNet Inception v1 Going Deeper with Convolutions|GoogLeNet (2014)]] / [[Inception (2014)]] → efficiency via factorization.
- **Successor:** [[ResNet (2015)]] → solved optimization issues via residuals.
- **Conceptual impact:** Opened the era of **deep feature learning** vs handcrafted features (HOG, SIFT, LBP).

# Implementation Notes
- **Pretrained models:** still used as a teaching baseline.
- **Limitations:** extremely large fully connected layers; heavy compute by modern standards; replaced quickly by deeper, more efficient models.
- **Legacy use:** educational demos, benchmarking early CNN ideas.

# Critiques / Limitations
- High parameter count in FC layers (120M+ parameters wasted).
- No batch normalization → harder optimization compared to later nets.
- Relatively shallow by today’s standards (8 vs 50+ layers in ResNet).
- Two-GPU hack was not generalizable.

- Dataset: [[ImageNet]]
- Code re-implementations: widely available in PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras.
