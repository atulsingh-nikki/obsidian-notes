The books and long-form research that live in this repository tend to move slowly. They collect notes, citations, and iterative drafts over weeks or months before they finally become something shareable. Until now there has not been a good place to talk about that process or capture the small wins that happen along the way.

This new blog fills that gap. Posts can highlight milestones, summarize what changed inside the note vault, and link out to artifacts worth revisiting. Because everything is version controlled, the blog doubles as a changelog: each entry explains why new folders appeared, when chapters were updated, or which questions are currently open.

Expect a mix of behind-the-scenes updates and short essays that provide more context than a repository commit message ever could. If you want a quick overview of what's new before diving into a book project, this is the place to start.
