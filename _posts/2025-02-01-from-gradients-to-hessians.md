## From Gradients to Hessians: How Optimization Shapes Vision & ML

**Anchor text**: Avriel, *Nonlinear Programming: Analysis and Methods* (Dover), Chapter 2.

Optimization isn’t academic trivia—it is the control room behind 3D reconstruction, optical flow, and billion-parameter networks. This note stitches together the classic conditions for extrema from Avriel with concrete computer-vision cases, including the scenarios where the Hessian turns degenerate and why that matters.

## First-Order Condition: Where Extrema Can Even Happen

For a smooth function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, any local extremum $x^*$ must satisfy the **first-order necessary condition**

$$\nabla f(x^*) = 0.$$

Avriel’s Theorem 2.3 states that if $x^*$ is a local minimum, then the Hessian at $x^*$ is positive semidefinite:

$$z^\top \nabla^2 f(x^*) z \ge 0 \quad \text{for all } z.$$

This only gives candidate points. To tell what kind of critical point you have reached, you have to look at curvature.

---

## Second-Order Condition: The Hessian Tells the Local Shape

Let $H = \nabla^2 f(x^*)$. The quadratic form $h^\top H h$ measures the second-order change of $f$ along direction $h$.

- **Positive definite** (all eigenvalues $> 0$) $\Rightarrow$ bowl $\Rightarrow$ strict local minimum.
- **Negative definite** $\Rightarrow$ dome $\Rightarrow$ strict local maximum.
- **Indefinite** (mixed signs) $\Rightarrow$ saddle.
- **Semidefinite with zero eigenvalues** $\Rightarrow$ flat directions / degeneracy.

Avriel’s Theorem 2.2 (sufficient condition) says: if $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ and $H$ is positive definite, then $x^*$ is a strict local minimum. Flip the inequalities for maxima.

**Why “necessary” vs “sufficient” matters:** Theorem 2.2 guarantees a minimum but can be too strong (it fails when there are flat directions). Theorem 2.3 must hold at any minimum, but by itself it doesn’t prove you have one.

## A One-Line Family That Shows the Difference (Avriel’s Example 2.1.1)

Consider $f(x) = x^{2p}$ with $p \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.

- $p = 1$: $f(x) = x^2$. We have $\nabla f(0) = 0$ and $f''(0) = 2 > 0$. Theorem 2.2 applies, so $0$ is a strict (also global) minimum.
- $p > 1$: $f(x) = x^{2p}$. We still have $\nabla f(0) = 0$, but $f''(0) = 0$. Theorem 2.2 fails (the Hessian is not positive definite), yet Theorem 2.3 holds (the Hessian is semidefinite). It is still a minimum—just flatter at the bottom.

*Tip*: simplify the second derivative before evaluating at $x=0$. For $p=1$, $f''(x) = (2p)(2p-1) x^{2p-2}$ reduces to $2$; there is no $0/0$ ambiguity.

## When Semidefinite Isn’t Enough: Degenerate Saddles

A point can satisfy Theorem 2.3 and still not be a minimum when higher-order terms matter.

- **Strict saddle**: $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$. The gradient vanishes at the origin, but $H = \operatorname{diag}(2, -2)$ is indefinite, so Theorem 2.3 fails—definitely not a minimum.
- **Degenerate saddle**: $f(x,y) = x^4 - y^4$. The gradient and Hessian are zero at the origin, so Theorem 2.3 passes, but the function still drops along the $y$-axis. Necessary doesn’t mean sufficient.

## Where Degenerate Hessians Show Up in Vision

- **Bundle adjustment (SfM/SLAM): gauge freedoms.** Reprojection error is unchanged by global translation/rotation and, in monocular setups, by global scale. The Hessian is rank-deficient (zero eigenvalues). Fixing a camera, point, or scale removes the degeneracy. (Triggs et al., IJCV 2000.)
- **Optical flow: the aperture problem.** Along a clean edge, motion parallel to the edge is unobservable, so the data-term Hessian is almost rank-1. Smoothness priors increase the rank. (Horn & Schunck, AI 1981.)
- **Photometric problems (shape-from-shading, photometric stereo).** Certain lighting/geometry combinations create flat valleys of equally good explanations. Regularization or additional illumination disambiguates.
- **Deep networks: flat minima.** Over-parameterization yields many near-zero Hessian eigenvalues; wide, flat minima often generalize better. (Dauphin et al., NeurIPS 2014.)

## Practical Compass

- Use Theorem 2.2 when you can show $H \succ 0$ to certify strict minima.
- Use Theorem 2.3 to screen candidates: any minimum must satisfy $H \succeq 0$, but check higher-order terms or structural invariances to rule out degenerate saddles.
- In real vision pipelines, expect degeneracy wherever there is invariance (gauge freedoms) or missing information (aperture problem).

## TL;DR

- Gradient zero gets you to the door.
- Hessian sign tells you what room you are in: bowl, dome, saddle, or flat.
- Vision problems breed degeneracy; handle it with gauges, priors, or extra cues.
