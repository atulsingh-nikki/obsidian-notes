# Summary
YOLO reframed object detection as a **single regression problem**: from image pixels directly to bounding-box coordinates and class probabilities. Instead of region proposals and multiple stages, YOLO processes the entire image in one forward pass. This enabled **real-time detection (45 FPS)** while maintaining competitive accuracy.

# Key Idea (one-liner)
> Treat detection as a single unified regression problem — directly predict bounding boxes and class probabilities from the whole image in one evaluation.

# Method
- **Grid division**: Input image divided into S×S grid (e.g., 7×7).
- **Bounding-box prediction**: Each grid cell predicts:
  - B bounding boxes (coordinates + confidence score).
  - Class probabilities.
- **Architecture**: Custom CNN inspired by GoogLeNet (24 conv layers + 2 fully connected layers).
- **Loss function**: sum-squared error combining localization loss + confidence loss + classification loss.
- **Training**: end-to-end with unified loss, no external region proposals.

# Results
- **Speed**: 45 FPS on VOC 2007/2012 (real-time).
- **Accuracy**: Slightly lower mAP than Faster R-CNN, but dramatically faster.
- **Error profile**: Fewer background false positives, but localization less precise.

# Why it Mattered
- Introduced **one-stage detection** as a paradigm shift.
- Showed speed–accuracy tradeoff in detection.
- Influenced SSD, RetinaNet, and later YOLO versions.
- Pushed object detection from research to practical real-time use cases.

# Architectural Pattern
- [[Single-Stage Detector]] → regression from pixels → boxes + classes.
- [[Grid-Based Prediction]] → spatial partitioning of image.
- [[Unified Loss Function]] → balances localization, confidence, and classification.
- [[Bounding Box Regression]] → direct coordinate prediction.

# Connections
- **Predecessors**: [[Faster R-CNN (2015)]] (two-stage, slower but more accurate).
- **Contemporaries**: [[SSD (2016)]] — another one-stage detector, anchor-based.
- **Successors**: [[YOLOv2 (2017)]], [[YOLOv3 (2018)]], [[YOLOv4 (2020)]], [[YOLOv5+]] — improving accuracy, flexibility, and deployment.
- **Influence**: Inspired modern real-time detectors used in robotics, surveillance, AR.

# Implementation Notes
- Strength: real-time speed, global context awareness (whole image at once).
- Weakness: localization errors, struggles with small objects.
- Backbone: custom CNN (later replaced by Darknet in YOLOv2+).
- Practical impact: widely adopted in open-source, real-world deployments.

# Critiques / Limitations
- Localization less precise than two-stage detectors.
- Poor recall for small objects.
- Struggles in crowded scenes (grid limitation).
- Rigid grid structure → improved later with anchors.
