# Summary
ZFNet (Zeiler & Fergus Net) improved upon [[AlexNet (ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)|AlexNet (2012)]] by tweaking hyperparameters and, crucially, introduced **deconvolutional visualizations** to understand what CNNs learn. It won the **ILSVRC 2013 classification competition**, beating [[AlexNet (ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)|AlexNet (2012)]] by a clear margin. Its contribution was not just performance but also interpretability, showing how intermediate feature maps encode visual structures.

# Key Idea (one-liner)
> Improve [[AlexNet (ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)|AlexNet (2012)]]’s architecture and introduce deconvolutional visualizations to open the “black box” of CNNs.

# Method
- **Architecture**:
  - Similar to [[AlexNet (ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)|AlexNet (2012)]] but with key changes:
    - Reduced first-layer filter size (from 11×11 to 7×7).
    - Smaller stride (4 → 2) for better feature resolution.
    - Increased depth of intermediate layers.
- **Visualization**:
  - Introduced **deconvolutional network (deconvnet)** to project activations back into image space.
  - Allowed inspection of what filters detect at each layer.
- **Training**:
  - GPU-based training on ImageNet.
  - Standard techniques: ReLU, dropout, data augmentation.

# Results
- **ILSVRC 2013**: won classification challenge with ~11.2% top-5 error (better than [[AlexNet (ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)|AlexNet (2012)]]’s ~15.3%).
- Visualizations revealed:
  - Lower layers: Gabor-like edges and color blobs.
  - Mid layers: textures and patterns.
  - Higher layers: object parts and semantics.
- Helped diagnose poor architectures and design better ones.

# Why it Mattered
- Showed CNNs are interpretable — visualization improved trust and debugging.
- First major **architecture analysis** study for CNNs.
- Influenced design of VGG, Inception, and later interpretability research.
- Bridged gap between performance and understanding.

# Architectural Pattern
- [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] → [[AlexNet (ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)|AlexNet (2012)]]-like backbone.
- [[Deconvolutional Networks]] → for visualization.
- [[Smaller Filters & Strides]] → higher resolution features.
- [[Interpretability in Deep Learning]].

# Connections
- **Predecessors**:
  - [[AlexNet (ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks)|AlexNet (2012)]] — first deep CNN on ImageNet.
- **Contemporaries**:
  - Early ILSVRC entries improving CNN hyperparameters.
- **Successors**:
  - [[Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition|VGGNet (2014)]] — deeper with smaller filters.
  - [[GoogLeNet Inception v1 Going Deeper with Convolutions|GoogLeNet (2014)]] — Inception modules.
  - [[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition|ResNet (2015)]] — residual learning.
- **Influence**:
  - Inspired visualization and explainability research.
  - Tools like Grad-CAM, feature inversion methods built on ZFNet.

# Implementation Notes
- Modest architecture changes gave big gains.
- Visualization tool was as impactful as accuracy improvement.
- Provided diagnostic method for designing better CNNs.

# Critiques / Limitations
- Improvements mainly hyperparameter tuning, not a fundamentally new paradigm.
- Deconvnet visualization helpful but limited (does not perfectly invert).
- Quickly surpassed by VGG and GoogLeNet in 2014.

# Repro / Resources
- Paper: [arXiv:1311.2901](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901)
- Dataset: [[ImageNet]]
- Visualization code widely reimplemented in PyTorch/TensorFlow.
- Top-5 error ~11.2% on ImageNet.
