## Introduction

The **Kalman Filter** is a recursive algorithm that provides optimal estimates of unknown variables based on a series of measurements observed over time. It was developed by Rudolf E. Kálmán in 1960 and has become one of the most important algorithms in control theory, signal processing, and estimation theory.

### What it does:
- Estimates the state of a dynamic system from noisy measurements
- Predicts future states based on current knowledge
- Updates predictions when new measurements become available
- Provides uncertainty quantification for estimates

### Why it's important:
- Optimal under certain conditions (linear systems, Gaussian noise)
- Computationally efficient
- Real-time capable
- Widely applicable across many domains

## Recursive Filters: Broader Context

### What are Recursive Filters?

A **recursive filter** is any filter that processes data sequentially, updating its internal state with each new observation. Unlike batch filters that require all data at once, recursive filters:

- Process one measurement at a time
- Maintain an internal state that summarizes all past information
- Update this state when new data arrives
- Can operate in real-time with bounded memory requirements

The Kalman filter is a specific type of recursive filter - arguably the most famous and successful one.

### Mathematical Framework

All recursive filters can be expressed in the general form:

**State Update**: $x̂_k = f(x̂_{k-1}, z_k, k)$
**Quality Measure**: $P_k = g(P_{k-1}, z_k, k)$

Where:
- $x̂_k$ = estimated state at time k
- $z_k$ = measurement at time k  
- $P_k$ = some measure of estimation quality/uncertainty
- $f()$, $g()$ = update functions specific to each filter type

### Key Properties of Recursive Filters

#### 1. **Memory Efficiency**
- Fixed memory requirements regardless of data length
- No need to store entire measurement history
- Suitable for embedded systems and real-time applications

#### 2. **Sequential Processing**
- Process measurements as they arrive
- No need to wait for complete dataset
- Natural fit for streaming data applications

#### 3. **Predictive Capability**
- Can forecast future states based on current estimates
- Useful for control systems and decision making
- Handle missing measurements gracefully

#### 4. **Adaptability**
- Can adapt to changing system characteristics
- Handle time-varying parameters
- Incorporate new measurement types dynamically

### Types of Recursive Filters

#### 0. **Recursive Average (Sample Mean)**

**Mathematical Derivation**: 

Let's derive the recursive average formula step by step, starting from the basic definition of sample mean.

**Step 1 - Definition of Sample Mean**:
For k measurements $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_k$, the sample mean is:
$$
\bar{z}_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k z_i
$$

**Step 2 - Separate the Latest Measurement**:
$$
\bar{z}_k = \frac{1}{k} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} z_i + z_k \right)
$$

**Step 3 - Express Previous Sum in Terms of Previous Average**:
Since $\bar{z}_{k-1} = \frac{1}{k-1} \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} z_i$, we have $\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} z_i = (k-1) \bar{z}_{k-1}$

Substituting:
$$
\bar{z}_k = \frac{1}{k} \left( (k-1) \bar{z}_{k-1} + z_k \right)
$$

**Step 4 - Expand and Rearrange**:
$$
\bar{z}_k = \frac{k-1}{k} \bar{z}_{k-1} + \frac{1}{k} z_k
$$

$$
\bar{z}_k = \bar{z}_{k-1} - \frac{1}{k} \bar{z}_{k-1} + \frac{1}{k} z_k
$$

$$
\bar{z}_k = \bar{z}_{k-1} + \frac{1}{k} (z_k - \bar{z}_{k-1})
$$

**Final Recursive Form**:
$$
\boxed{\bar{z}_k = \bar{z}_{k-1} + \frac{1}{k}(z_k - \bar{z}_{k-1})}
$$

**Interpretation**: This shows that the new average equals the old average plus a fraction (1/k) of the **innovation** or **prediction error** $(z_k - \bar{z}_{k-1})$.

**Key Insights**:
- **Innovation**: $(z_k - \bar{z}_{k-1})$ represents how much the new measurement differs from our current estimate
- **Gain**: $\frac{1}{k}$ determines how much we trust the new measurement vs. our previous estimate
- **Adaptation**: As k increases, the gain decreases, making the filter less responsive to new data
- **Memory**: All previous measurements contribute equally to the final estimate

**Alternative Forms**:

*Weighted Average Form*:
$$
\bar{z}_k = \left(1 - \frac{1}{k}\right) \bar{z}_{k-1} + \frac{1}{k} z_k
$$

*General Recursive Filter Form*:
$$
\text{New Estimate} = \text{Old Estimate} + \text{Gain} \times \text{Innovation}
$$

**Why This Derivation Matters**:

1. **Foundation Pattern**: This derivation reveals the fundamental pattern that ALL recursive filters follow:
   - Take previous estimate
   - Compute prediction error (innovation)
   - Update estimate based on weighted error

2. **Gain Evolution**: The gain $\frac{1}{k}$ shows how our confidence in new data changes:
   - $k=1$: Gain = 1.0 (completely trust first measurement)
   - $k=2$: Gain = 0.5 (equal weight to old and new)
   - $k=100$: Gain = 0.01 (very small updates)

3. **Connection to Other Filters**: 
   - **Exponential Smoothing**: Uses fixed gain α instead of $\frac{1}{k}$
   - **Kalman Filter**: Computes optimal time-varying gain based on uncertainties
   - **All filters**: Follow the same "estimate + gain × innovation" structure

4. **Optimality**: For the specific case of estimating a constant from noisy measurements, this recursive average is provably optimal (minimizes mean squared error).

**Numerical Example**:

Let's trace through the first few steps with concrete numbers:
- True value: 10.0 (unknown to us)
- Measurements: $z_1 = 12.0$, $z_2 = 9.5$, $z_3 = 10.8$

*Step 1*: $\bar{z}_1 = z_1 = 12.0$ (gain = 1.0)
*Step 2*: $\bar{z}_2 = 12.0 + \frac{1}{2}(9.5 - 12.0) = 12.0 - 1.25 = 10.75$ (gain = 0.5)
*Step 3*: $\bar{z}_3 = 10.75 + \frac{1}{3}(10.8 - 10.75) = 10.75 + 0.017 = 10.767$ (gain = 0.33)

Notice how the estimate converges toward the true value, and updates become smaller as we gain confidence.

**Visual Understanding**:

The recursive formula can be understood as:
$$
Current Best Guess = Previous Best Guess + Small Correction
                   = Previous Best Guess + (1/k) × Surprise
$$

Where $"Surprise" = (New Measurement - Previous Best Guess)$

As k increases, we become more confident in our current estimate, so we make smaller corrections (smaller gain 1/k).

**Properties**:
- Simplest recursive filter (building block for all others)
- Time-varying gain: $α_k = 1/k$ (decreases over time)
- Optimal for constant signals corrupted by noise
- Perfect memory: all observations weighted equally
- Unbiased estimator with variance reduction as $σ²/k$

**Applications**: Laboratory measurements, sensor calibration, Monte Carlo estimation

#### 1. **Exponential Smoothing (Simple Recursive Filter)**

**Mathematical Derivation with Examples**:

Exponential smoothing emerges from the desire to weight recent observations more heavily than older ones, but in a systematic way.

**Concrete Example Setup**: 
Let's track daily temperature readings with α = 0.3:
- Day 1: 20°C
- Day 2: 25°C  
- Day 3: 18°C
- Day 4: 22°C

We'll derive the recursive form by working through this example step by step.

**Step 1 - Motivation**: 
Unlike recursive average (equal weights), we want newer data to have more influence. Let's assign exponentially decaying weights to past observations.

**Step 2 - Weighted Average with Exponential Weights**:
For current time k, weight observations as:
- Current observation $z_k$: weight = $α$
- Previous observation $z_{k-1}$: weight = $α(1-α)$  
- Two steps back $z_{k-2}$: weight = $α(1-α)^2$
- Three steps back $z_{k-3}$: weight = $α(1-α)^3$
- And so on...

**Example**: For Day 4 (22°C) with α = 0.3, the weights are:
- Day 4 (22°C): weight = 0.3 = 30%
- Day 3 (18°C): weight = 0.3 × 0.7 = 0.21 = 21%
- Day 2 (25°C): weight = 0.3 × 0.7² = 0.3 × 0.49 = 0.147 = 14.7%  
- Day 1 (20°C): weight = 0.3 × 0.7³ = 0.3 × 0.343 = 0.103 = 10.3%

**Step 3 - Infinite Weighted Sum**:
$$
x̂_k = α z_k + α(1-α) z_{k-1} + α(1-α)^2 z_{k-2} + α(1-α)^3 z_{k-3} + \ldots
$$

$$
x̂_k = α \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (1-α)^i z_{k-i}
$$

**Example Calculation**: For Day 4:
$$
x̂_4 = 0.3(22) + 0.21(18) + 0.147(25) + 0.103(20)
$$
$$
x̂_4 = 6.6 + 3.78 + 3.675 + 2.06 = 16.115°C
$$

*Note: Weights sum to 0.3 + 0.21 + 0.147 + 0.103 = 0.76. For infinite series, weights sum to 1.0.*

**Step 4 - Derive Recursive Form**:
For the previous estimate:
$$
x̂_{k-1} = α z_{k-1} + α(1-α) z_{k-2} + α(1-α)^2 z_{k-3} + \ldots
$$

$$
x̂_{k-1} = α \sum_{i=0}^{k-2} (1-α)^i z_{k-1-i}
$$

**Example**: For Day 3:
$$
x̂_3 = 0.3(18) + 0.21(25) + 0.103(20) = 5.4 + 5.25 + 2.06 = 12.71°C
$$

**Step 5 - Algebraic Manipulation**:
Multiply $x̂_{k-1}$ by $(1-α)$:
$$
(1-α)x̂_{k-1} = α(1-α) z_{k-1} + α(1-α)^2 z_{k-2} + α(1-α)^3 z_{k-3} + \ldots
$$

**Example**: 
$(1-0.3) × 12.71 = 0.7 × 12.71 = 8.897$

This equals: $0.21(18) + 0.147(25) + 0.103(20) = 3.78 + 3.675 + 2.06 = 9.515$

*(Small difference due to rounding in finite vs infinite series)*

**Step 6 - Substitute and Simplify**:
From Step 3: $x̂_k = α z_k + α(1-α) z_{k-1} + α(1-α)^2 z_{k-2} + \ldots$

From Step 5: $(1-α)x̂_{k-1} = α(1-α) z_{k-1} + α(1-α)^2 z_{k-2} + \ldots$

**Key Insight**: The infinite tail in Step 3 equals $(1-α)x̂_{k-1}$ from Step 5!

Therefore:
$$
x̂_k = α z_k + (1-α)x̂_{k-1}
$$

**Example Verification**: For Day 4:
- Direct calculation (Step 3): $x̂_4 = 16.115°C$
- Recursive formula: $x̂_4 = 0.3(22) + 0.7(12.71) = 6.6 + 8.897 = 15.497°C$

*(Small difference due to finite vs infinite series, but the recursive form is much more efficient!)*

**Final Recursive Form**:
$$
\boxed{x̂_k = α z_k + (1-α) x̂_{k-1}}
$$

**Complete Worked Example - Day by Day**:

Let's trace through all temperature readings using the recursive formula:

*Day 1*: $x̂_1 = 20°C$ (initialization)

*Day 2*: $x̂_2 = 0.3(25) + 0.7(20) = 7.5 + 14 = 21.5°C$

*Day 3*: $x̂_3 = 0.3(18) + 0.7(21.5) = 5.4 + 15.05 = 20.45°C$

*Day 4*: $x̂_4 = 0.3(22) + 0.7(20.45) = 6.6 + 14.315 = 20.915°C$

**What Just Happened?**
- We stored only 3 numbers: current estimate, new measurement, parameter α
- No need to keep all historical data!  
- Each step incorporates all previous history through the recursive structure
- The estimate smoothly adapts: 20° → 21.5° → 20.45° → 20.915°

**Alternative Form (Innovation-Based)**:
$$
x̂_k = x̂_{k-1} + α(z_k - x̂_{k-1})
$$

This shows: New Estimate = Old Estimate + α × Innovation

**Example using Innovation Form** for Day 3:
- Previous estimate: $x̂_2 = 21.5°C$
- New measurement: $z_3 = 18°C$ 
- Innovation: $18 - 21.5 = -3.5°C$ (measurement is cooler than expected)
- Update: $x̂_3 = 21.5 + 0.3(-3.5) = 21.5 - 1.05 = 20.45°C$

**Parameter Effect Comparison**:

Using the same temperature data [20°C, 25°C, 18°C, 22°C]:

**α = 0.1 (Conservative)**:
- Day 1: 20.0°C
- Day 2: 0.1(25) + 0.9(20) = 20.5°C  
- Day 3: 0.1(18) + 0.9(20.5) = 20.25°C
- Day 4: 0.1(22) + 0.9(20.25) = 20.425°C

**α = 0.7 (Aggressive)**:
- Day 1: 20.0°C
- Day 2: 0.7(25) + 0.3(20) = 23.5°C
- Day 3: 0.7(18) + 0.3(23.5) = 19.65°C  
- Day 4: 0.7(22) + 0.3(19.65) = 21.295°C

**Comparison**:
- α = 0.1: Final estimate = 20.425°C (smooth, barely changed from initial)
- α = 0.3: Final estimate = 20.915°C (balanced adaptation)
- α = 0.7: Final estimate = 21.295°C (responsive, tracks changes closely)

**The Mathematical Beauty**: 
An infinite weighted sum $α z_k + α(1-α)z_{k-1} + α(1-α)^2 z_{k-2} + \ldots$ becomes simply $α z_k + (1-α)x̂_{k-1}$!

**Why "Exponential"?**
The weights decay exponentially: $α, α(1-α), α(1-α)^2, α(1-α)^3, \ldots$

**Key Insights**:
- **Fixed Gain**: Unlike recursive average (gain = 1/k), exponential smoothing uses constant gain α
- **Exponential Memory**: Recent observations weighted exponentially more than older ones
- **Parameter α**: Controls the trade-off between responsiveness and smoothness
  - $α = 1$: Only current observation matters (no smoothing)
  - $α = 0$: No updating (infinite smoothing)
  - $α = 0.1$: Smooth, slow adaptation
  - $α = 0.9$: Responsive, minimal smoothing

**Weight Distribution Example** (α = 0.3):
- Current: 0.30 (30%)
- 1 step back: 0.21 (21%) 
- 2 steps back: 0.147 (14.7%)
- 3 steps back: 0.103 (10.3%)
- 4 steps back: 0.072 (7.2%)

Notice how weights sum to 1.0 and decay exponentially!

**Numerical Example** (α = 0.3):

Let's trace through the first few steps with the same data as before:
- Measurements: $z_1 = 12.0$, $z_2 = 9.5$, $z_3 = 10.8$

*Step 1*: $x̂_1 = z_1 = 12.0$ (initialization)
*Step 2*: $x̂_2 = 0.3(9.5) + 0.7(12.0) = 2.85 + 8.4 = 11.25$
*Step 3*: $x̂_3 = 0.3(10.8) + 0.7(11.25) = 3.24 + 7.875 = 11.115$

**Comparison with Recursive Average**:
- Recursive Average at step 3: 10.767
- Exponential Smoothing: 11.115

The exponential smoothing estimate is "stickier" to the initial high value (12.0) because it gives exponentially decaying weight to all past observations, while recursive average treats all observations equally.

**Memory Horizon**:
The effective memory length is approximately $\frac{1}{α}$:
- $α = 0.1$: Memory ≈ 10 steps
- $α = 0.3$: Memory ≈ 3.3 steps  
- $α = 0.9$: Memory ≈ 1.1 steps

**Connection to Recursive Average**:
As $α \to 0$, exponential smoothing behaves like recursive average with very long memory. However, they're fundamentally different:
- **Recursive Average**: Time-varying gain $\frac{1}{k}$, perfect memory
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Fixed gain $α$, exponential memory decay

**Properties**:
- Simplest recursive filter
- Exponentially decreasing weights for past data
- Single parameter α controls memory length
- No explicit uncertainty quantification

**Applications**: Financial forecasting, trend analysis, simple signal smoothing

#### 2. **Recursive Least Squares (RLS)**

**Parameter Estimation**:

$$θ̂_k = θ̂_{k-1} + K_k·(z_k - H_k·θ̂_{k-1})$$

$$K_k = P_{k-1}·H_k^T·(λ + H_k·P_{k-1}·H_k^T)^{-1}$$

$$P_k = λ^{-1}·(P_{k-1} - K_k·H_k·P_{k-1})$$


**Properties**:
- Estimates constant parameters from noisy measurements

$$v_k = v_{k-1} + β·(z_k - x_{k-1} - v_{k-1}·Δt)/Δt$$

**Properties**:

$$

**Properties**:

Prediction: x_k^(i) ~ p(x_k | x_{k-1}^(i)) 
Update: w_k^(i) ∝ w_{k-1}^(i) · p(z_k | x_k^(i)) 
$$

**Properties**:

**Applications**: Computer vision, robotics, target tracking, econometrics

#### 6. **Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Filters**

Viterbi Algorithm: Most likely state sequence
$$

**Properties**:
- Discrete state spaces
- Handles switching dynamics
- Efficient forward-backward algorithms
- Foundation for many modern ML techniques

**Applications**: Speech recognition, bioinformatics, finance (regime switching)

### Connection to Kalman Filtering

The Kalman filter is a **specific instance** of recursive filtering that:

1. **Assumes linear dynamics** and Gaussian noise
2. **Computes optimal gains** based on statistical models
3. **Propagates full uncertainty** information
4. **Minimizes mean squared error** under its assumptions

Understanding recursive filters broadly helps appreciate:
- Why Kalman filtering is so powerful (optimality under linear-Gaussian assumptions)
- How the Kalman filter generalizes simpler methods (recursive average is a special case)
- When other approaches might be better (nonlinear, computational constraints)
- How to extend Kalman filtering (multi-model, adaptive approaches)
- The fundamental principles underlying all sequential estimation

**Key Insight**: The recursive average with gain α_k = 1/k is actually what you get from a Kalman filter when:
- F = 1, H = 1 (scalar system, direct measurement)
- Q = 0 (no process noise - constant signal)
- R = σ² (measurement noise), P_0 → ∞ (very uncertain initial state)

This shows how all recursive filters are related through the common framework of sequential Bayesian estimation!

## Mathematical Foundations

### State Space Representation

A dynamic system can be represented in state space form:

**System Model (Process/Prediction):**
$$
x_k = F_k * x_{k-1} + B_k * u_k + w_k
$$

**Measurement Model (Observation/Update):**
$$
z_k = H_k * x_k + v_k
$$

Where:
- $x_k$ = state vector at time k
- $F_k$ = state transition model
- $B_k$ = control input model
- $u_k$ = control vector
- $w_k$ = process noise (Gaussian, zero-mean, covariance Q_k)
- $z_k$ = measurement vector
- $H_k$ = observation model
- $v_k$ = measurement noise (Gaussian, zero-mean, covariance R_k)

### Assumptions

1. **Linear System**: The system dynamics and measurements are linear
2. **Gaussian Noise**: All noise sources are Gaussian with known covariances
3. **Known Models**: F, B, H, Q, R matrices are known
4. **Markov Property**: Current state depends only on previous state

---

## The Kalman Filter Algorithm

The Kalman filter operates in two phases: **Predict** and **Update**.

### Predict Phase (Time Update)

**1. State Prediction:**
$$
x̂_k|k-1 = F_k * x̂_{k-1|k-1} + B_k * u_k
$$

**2. Error Covariance Prediction:**
$$
P_k|k-1 = F_k * P_{k-1|k-1} * F_k^T + Q_k
$$

### Update Phase (Measurement Update)

**3. Innovation/Residual:**
$$
ỹ_k = z_k - H_k * x̂_k|k-1
$$

**4. Innovation Covariance:**
$$
S_k = H_k * P_k|k-1 * H_k^T + R_k
$$

**5. Kalman Gain:**
$$
K_k = P_k|k-1 * H_k^T * S_k^{-1}
$$

**6. State Update:**
$$
x̂_k|k = x̂_k|k-1 + K_k * ỹ_k
$$

**7. Error Covariance Update:**
$$
P_k|k = (I - K_k * H_k) * P_k|k-1
$$

### Notation
- $x̂_k|k$ = estimate of x at time k given measurements up to time k
- $x̂_k|k-1$ = estimate of x at time k given measurements up to time k-1
- $P_k|k$ = error covariance matrix at time k given measurements up to time k
- $P_k|k-1$ = error covariance matrix at time k given measurements up to time k-1

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Kalman Gain ($K_k$)**
- Controls how much the new measurement influences the state estimate
- High gain → trust measurements more
- Low gain → trust predictions more
- Automatically computed based on relative uncertainties

### 2. **Covariance Matrices**
- **P**: State error covariance (uncertainty in state estimate)
- **Q**: Process noise covariance (uncertainty in system model)
- **R**: Measurement noise covariance (uncertainty in measurements)

### 3. **Innovation/Residual ($ỹ_k$)**
- Difference between actual measurement and predicted measurement
- Indicates how well the model predicts the measurements
- Should be zero-mean white noise if filter is working correctly

### 4. **Observability and Controllability**
- **Observability**: Can we determine the state from measurements?
- **Controllability**: Can we control the state through inputs?
- Both are crucial for filter performance

## Types of Kalman Filters

### 1. **Linear Kalman Filter**
- Original form described above
- For linear systems with Gaussian noise

### 2. **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**
- For nonlinear systems
- Uses linearization around current estimate
- May diverge if nonlinearities are strong

### 3. **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)**
- Better handling of nonlinearities
- Uses sigma points instead of linearization
- More accurate but computationally expensive

### 4. **Particle Filter**
- For highly nonlinear/non-Gaussian systems
- Uses Monte Carlo methods
- Most flexible but most computationally intensive
