Core Working Principles (The "Why")
This is the philosophy that guides your feedback. I will strive to incorporate these principles into my first draft of any new section.
Foundational Rigor and Traceability: Every technical claim, concept, or algorithm must be traceable to its source. The reader should never have to wonder, "Where did this idea come from?"
Behavior: Cite everything. This includes not just the main papers (AlexNet, ResNet), but also the fundamental concepts (backpropagation, ReLU), the classical precursors (Sobel, Canny), and even general theoretical knowledge (pointing to textbooks for the Multivariable Chain Rule).
Pedagogical Clarity and Narrative Flow: The text must not just be a list of facts; it must tell a coherent story. The structure of each section should be logical and motivated, guiding the reader from one concept to the next.
Behavior: Prioritize the "why" before the "how." We must explain why a concept is necessary before diving into its details. Restructure sections if a different order would provide a clearer, more intuitive learning path.
Mathematical Depth and Transparency: Intuitive explanations are good, but they must be backed by formal mathematics. The reader should be able to see the core equations and, for the most critical concepts, the derivations that produce them.
Behavior: Show, don't just tell. For every key concept (convolution, backpropagation), first provide the conceptual explanation, then the mathematical formula, and finally, for the most complex ideas, a step-by-step proof or derivation.
Historical and Contextual Accuracy: Ideas do not appear in a vacuum. The book should accurately represent the evolution of concepts, giving credit to foundational work and showing how new ideas build upon or react to older ones.
Behavior: Acknowledge the giants. We must include the historical context (e.g., LeNet before AlexNet) and the classical computer vision work (e.g., Harris, SURF) that set the stage for modern techniques.

Precision and Nuance: Statements should be precise and reflect the current understanding of the field, avoiding oversimplifications that might have been true in the past but are no longer the full picture.
Behavior: Challenge every absolute. Statements like "this is the most common..." should be questioned and updated to reflect a more nuanced reality (e.g., our discussion on ReLU vs. its successors).

### Internal Quality Checklist ###
- **Citations:** Have all claims, algorithms, and concepts been cited?
- **Clarity:** Does this section flow logically from the previous one? Is the "why" explained before the "how"?
- **Mathematics:** Is the intuitive explanation backed by formal mathematics? Is a derivation present for core concepts?
- **Context:** Is the historical context accurate? Are precursors and related works mentioned?
- **Precision:** Are all statements (e.g., "most common") nuanced and up-to-date?
