# Summary
**Retinex Theory** (Land & McCann, 1971) proposed a **computational model of human color perception**. It explains how humans perceive consistent colors under varying illumination (color constancy).  

The theory inspired decades of research in **illumination correction**, **image enhancement**, and **intrinsic image decomposition**.

# Key Idea
> Color perception arises not from absolute pixel intensities but from **spatial comparisons across the scene**.  
> The brain computes reflectance by comparing ratios of lightness over long-range paths, making perceived color relatively invariant to illumination.

# Method (Original Formulation)
- Simulate human retina + cortex processing (“Retinex”).  
- Compute lightness/color by comparing each pixel with pixels along multiple paths across the image.  
- Ratios across paths → stable estimate of reflectance independent of global lighting.  

# Results
- Human observers perceive surfaces as having stable colors even under dramatic lighting shifts.  
- Retinex offered a computational explanation.  
- Early Retinex algorithms applied this principle to digital images.  

# Why it Mattered
- Introduced the **illumination vs reflectance decomposition problem**.  
- Directly influenced computational color constancy research (e.g., Gray World, Gamut Mapping).  
- Led to widely used **Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR)** for digital photography and remote sensing.  

# Architectural Pattern
- Ratio-based comparisons along paths.  
- Later: multi-scale filtering approximations.  

# Connections
- Related to **Gray World assumption (1980)** as a simplified model.  
- Anticipated modern **intrinsic image decomposition** and **low-light enhancement**.  
- Complementary to histogram-based contrast methods.  

# Implementation Notes
- Original Retinex: computationally heavy due to path comparisons.  
- Practical variants: Single-Scale Retinex (SSR), Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR).  
- Still used in image enhancement and low-light correction pipelines.  

# Critiques / Limitations
- Biological plausibility debated.  
- Original algorithm = expensive.  
- Later implementations often heuristic approximations.

# Educational Connections

## Undergraduate-Level Concepts
- Illumination vs reflectance in vision.  
- Why objects look the same color under different lights.  
- Path-based comparisons = context-driven perception.  

## Postgraduate-Level Concepts
- Mathematical formulations of Retinex (ratio models, path integrals).  
- Multi-scale approximations for practical use.  
- Relationship to modern **intrinsic image decomposition** and **deep learning color constancy**.  
- Applications in computational photography and medical imaging.

# My Notes
- Retinex = **perceptual root of color constancy**.  
- Not just an algorithm: a paradigm shift → perception = relative, not absolute.  
- Legacy lives in both theory (vision science) and practice (MSR, photography).
