# Summary
Faster R-CNN unified object detection into an **end-to-end trainable framework** by replacing **Selective Search** with a **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**. The RPN generates object proposals directly from feature maps, which are then refined by Fast R-CNN detection heads. This made object detection significantly faster and more accurate, setting a new standard for two-stage detectors.

# Key Idea (one-liner)
> Replace external region proposals (Selective Search) with a trainable Region Proposal Network (RPN), enabling nearly real-time, end-to-end object detection.

# Method
- **Backbone**: CNN (e.g., ZFNet, [[Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition|VGGNet (2014)]], ResNet).
- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**:
  - Slides a small conv net over feature map.
  - At each location, generates k anchors (different scales/aspect ratios).
  - Outputs objectness score + bounding box offsets.
- **ROI Pooling**: crops and warps features for each proposal.
- **Detection Head**: Fast R-CNN style classifier + bounding box regressor.
- **Training**: multi-task loss combining classification + regression; alternating optimization between RPN and detector.

# Results
- Achieved near real-time detection (5–17 FPS, depending on backbone).
- Significant improvement over Fast R-CNN with Selective Search (10× faster).
- State-of-the-art mAP on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks.

# Why it Mattered
- First **end-to-end trainable object detector** with integrated proposal generation.
- Removed the bottleneck of hand-crafted proposal methods.
- Established two-stage detector family (Faster R-CNN → Mask R-CNN).
- Anchors became a **core concept** for later detectors (SSD, YOLOv2).

# Architectural Pattern
- [[Region Proposal Network]] → trainable replacement for Selective Search.
- [[Anchor Boxes]] → multi-scale, multi-aspect priors.
- [[ROI Pooling]] → fixed-size feature extraction.
- [[Two-Stage Detectors]] → proposal generation + classification.

# Connections
- **Predecessors**:
  - [[R-CNN (2014)]] → CNN features + SVM classifier.
  - [[Fast R-CNN (2015)]] → single-stage training, ROI pooling.
- **Successors**:
  - [[Mask R-CNN (2017)]] → added segmentation branch.
  - [[Cascade R-CNN (2018)]] → multi-stage refinement.
- **Alternatives**:
  - [[YOLO (2016)]] → real-time, single-stage detector.
  - [[SSD (2016)]] → dense anchors, faster inference.

# Implementation Notes
- Inference speed: 5–17 FPS depending on backbone.
- Still widely used as baseline for accuracy-oriented detectors.
- Training requires careful balance between RPN and detector loss.
- ResNet backbones improved accuracy significantly.

# Critiques / Limitations
- Slower than single-shot methods (YOLO, SSD).
- Anchor-based → sensitive to anchor hyperparameters.
- ROI pooling introduces misalignments (fixed later by ROIAlign in Mask R-CNN).
- Still complex pipeline compared to one-stage detectors.

# Repro / Resources
- Paper: [arXiv:1506.01497](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)
- Dataset: [[PASCAL VOC]], [[MS COCO]]
- Official Caffe code (later PyTorch/TensorFlow ports).
- Pretrained models widely available.
