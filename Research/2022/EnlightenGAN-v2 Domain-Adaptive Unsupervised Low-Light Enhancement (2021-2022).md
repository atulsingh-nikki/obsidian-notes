# Summary
**EnlightenGAN-v2** extended **EnlightenGAN** with **domain adaptation techniques** to make the GAN-based enhancement more robust across datasets and real-world distributions.  

It targeted one weakness of EnlightenGAN: limited generalization when trained on specific datasets.

# Key Idea
> Introduce **domain-adaptive training** and refined adversarial objectives to generalize GAN-based enhancement across unseen low-light conditions.

# Method
- **Domain Adaptation Losses:** adversarial + perceptual constraints across domains.  
- **Improved Attention Mechanisms:** better illumination map guidance.  
- **Enhanced Training Stability:** refined discriminator strategy.  

# Results
- Better generalization to new datasets compared to original EnlightenGAN.  
- More stable training, fewer artifacts.  
- Visual quality closer to Zero-DCE++ while keeping GAN realism.  

# Why it Mattered
- Showed how GAN-based enhancement can be **made domain-robust**.  
- Strengthened GANs’ role alongside Retinex/curve models in low-light pipelines.  

# Critiques / Limitations
- Still GAN-based → risk of hallucinations.  
- More computationally demanding than curve-based methods.  

# Educational Connections
- Undergrad: Basics of domain adaptation.  
- Postgrad: How domain shifts affect GAN performance, strategies for unsupervised domain adaptation.
