# Summary
**Subspace Video Stabilization (Liu et al., SIGGRAPH 2011)** introduced a **subspace-based approach** to video stabilization. Instead of relying solely on 2D transforms or local warps, it modeled camera trajectories in a **low-dimensional subspace** and smoothed them, producing cinematic-quality stabilization.

# Key Idea
> Represent camera trajectories as curves in a low-dimensional **subspace**, then smooth these trajectories while constraining the warping to avoid excessive distortion.

# Method
- Track feature trajectories across frames.  
- Represent trajectories in a subspace (via PCA or low-rank modeling).  
- Smooth trajectories in this space to remove high-frequency jitter.  
- Apply **content-preserving warps** to produce stabilized video.  

# Results
- Produced smoother, more cinematic results than 2009 warping.  
- Controlled distortion better by leveraging trajectory subspaces.  
- Became one of the most cited video stabilization methods.  

# Why it Mattered
- Advanced video stabilization beyond content-preserving warps.  
- Widely adopted in industry (basis for stabilization in consumer video software).  
- Inspired deep-learning approaches for end-to-end stabilization.  

# Architectural Pattern
- Feature tracking → trajectory subspace → smoothing → warping.  

# Connections
- Built on **content-preserving warps (2009)**.  
- Predecessor to **learning-based stabilization (2018+)**.  
- Applications in video editing, drones, mobile video capture.  

# Implementation Notes
- Handles longer sequences robustly.  
- Efficient enough for practical deployment.  
- Still depends on good feature tracking.  

# Critiques / Limitations
- Struggles with severe occlusions or very dynamic foreground objects.  
- Not fully robust to rolling shutter distortions.  
- Requires temporal windows (can lag in real-time).

# Educational Connections

## Undergraduate-Level Concepts
- Camera shake can be removed by smoothing the **path of motion**.  
- Subspace = compressing complex trajectories into simpler components.  
- Example: shaky handheld video → smooth cinematic trajectory.  

## Postgraduate-Level Concepts
- Low-rank modeling of trajectories.  
- Optimization in subspaces for temporal signals.  
- Trade-offs: trajectory fidelity vs distortion control.  
- Connection to later deep-learning-based trajectory prediction.

# My Notes
- Subspace method = **the industrial breakthrough** for stabilization.  
- Bridges vision and graphics: math + perceptual quality.  
- Open question: Will learned latent spaces (autoencoders, transformers) replace handcrafted subspaces?  
- Possible extension: End-to-end stabilization with latent subspace learning + warping.
