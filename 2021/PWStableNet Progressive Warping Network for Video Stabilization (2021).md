# Summary
**PWStableNet (CVPR 2021)** proposed a **progressive warping network** for video stabilization. Unlike single-stage CNNs, it **iteratively refines stabilization warps in multiple stages**, improving both **temporal consistency** and **global–local balance** in warping.

# Key Idea
> Stabilization can be improved by **progressively refining warps**: start with coarse stabilization, then iteratively produce finer, more consistent adjustments using a multi-stage network.

# Method
- **Input**: Unstable video frames.  
- **Network**: Multi-stage progressive warping CNN.  
  - Stage 1: Coarse warp estimation (global).  
  - Stage 2–N: Refinement of local details.  
- **Losses**:  
  - Stability loss (smooth camera path).  
  - Distortion control loss (avoid stretching content).  
  - Temporal consistency loss.  
- **Output**: Final stabilized frames with both global and local corrections.  

# Results
- Outperformed prior deep methods (DeepFlow, StabNet, Online Stabilization).  
- Improved **temporal smoothness** (less flickering).  
- Better at balancing **global trajectory smoothing** with **local content preservation**.  

# Why it Mattered
- Showed stabilization benefits from **multi-stage refinement**, not single-pass CNNs.  
- Introduced progressive design → later reused in transformer and NeRF-based stabilization pipelines.  
- Bridged global vs local stabilization.  

# Architectural Pattern
- Progressive refinement: coarse-to-fine stabilization warps.  
- Multi-loss optimization for smoothness + realism.  

# Connections
- Built on **DeepFlow (2020)** (flow-based input).  
- Related to **progressive refinement in GANs / SR networks**.  
- Predecessor to **transformer-based stabilization (2021–2022)**.  

# Implementation Notes
- Requires GPU, heavier than single-stage CNNs.  
- Can generalize better across diverse shake patterns.  
- Stronger temporal consistency than previous methods.  

# Critiques / Limitations
- Still 2D warping (not full 3D structure-aware).  
- Computationally expensive vs StabNet/DeepFlow.  
- Needs large datasets to train well.

# Educational Connections

## Undergraduate-Level Concepts
- Progressive = fix big problems first, then refine details.  
- Stabilization network works like polishing shaky video in steps.  
- Example: smoothing a shaky bicycle video — first remove large wobbles, then fix smaller jitters.  

## Postgraduate-Level Concepts
- Multi-stage CNN architectures for refinement.  
- Balancing global motion smoothing with local warping constraints.  
- Temporal consistency losses for video-level training.  
- Extension: progressive refinement combined with transformers.  

---

# My Notes
- PWStableNet = **stabilization learns patience** — iterative refinement works better.  
- Key contribution: balance between global cinematic path + local distortion control.  
- Open question: Could progressive refinement be merged with 3D scene priors (NeRF/Gaussians)?  
- Possible extension: Progressive neural fields for **3D-aware stabilization**.
