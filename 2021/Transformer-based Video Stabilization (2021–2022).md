# Summary
**Transformer-based Video Stabilization (2021–2022)** methods (e.g., T-CVSR, Xu et al.) applied **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** to stabilization, enabling modeling of **long-range temporal dependencies**. Unlike CNN-based online methods, transformers capture global context over hundreds of frames, improving smoothness and visual consistency.

# Key Idea
> Use **transformers** to model long-term temporal correlations in shaky video, enabling stabilization that is smoother, more consistent, and less prone to frame-by-frame jitter.

# Method
- **Backbone**: Vision Transformer (ViT) or spatio-temporal transformer.  
- **Inputs**: Sequences of shaky frames.  
- **Outputs**: Predicted stable trajectories or warping fields.  
- **Losses**:  
  - Stability loss (trajectory smoothness).  
  - Content preservation loss (avoid geometric distortion).  
  - Temporal consistency loss (across long frame windows).  

# Results
- Outperformed CNN-based DeepStab and Deep Online methods.  
- Produced **cinematic, globally smooth results** (not just local stabilization).  
- More robust to sudden shakes or long sequences.  

# Why it Mattered
- Brought **global temporal modeling** into video stabilization.  
- Represented the shift from local CNN-based approaches to global sequence models.  
- Foundation for next-gen stabilization (NeRF-based, implicit 3D scene models).  

# Architectural Pattern
- Transformer encoder-decoder on frame embeddings.  
- Predicts either stabilized trajectories or per-frame warp fields.  

# Connections
- Successor to **Deep Online Stabilization (2019)**.  
- Related to transformer-based video tasks (action recognition, captioning).  
- Predecessor to **NeRF-based stabilization (2023+)**.  

# Implementation Notes
- Requires GPU acceleration, heavier than CNNs.  
- Training needs large-scale video datasets.  
- Window size trade-off: longer = smoother, slower.  

# Critiques / Limitations
- Computationally expensive (not always real-time).  
- Still fundamentally 2D warp–based (limited 3D reasoning).  
- Performance depends on training dataset diversity.

# Educational Connections

## Undergraduate-Level Concepts
- CNN = looks at local frames; Transformer = can "see" far back in the sequence.  
- Stabilization = learning smoother long-term camera paths.  
- Example: walking with a shaky phone camera → stabilized output looks like filmed on a dolly.  

## Postgraduate-Level Concepts
- Self-attention for temporal modeling.  
- Stability vs distortion trade-off in sequence prediction.  
- Transformers vs CNNs for sequence-to-sequence video tasks.  
- Future: combine transformers with **3D implicit scene models**.  

---

# My Notes
- Transformer-based stabilization = **deep stabilization matures**.  
- Global context fixes CNN jitter issues.  
- Open question: Can transformers + NeRFs enable true 3D scene-aware stabilization?  
- Possible extension: Foundation models for video stabilization as part of **general-purpose video editing**.
