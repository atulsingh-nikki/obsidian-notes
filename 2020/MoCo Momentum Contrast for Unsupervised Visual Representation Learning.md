# Summary
MoCo (Momentum Contrast) introduced a **dynamic memory queue and momentum encoder** to perform contrastive learning with many negatives efficiently. Unlike SimCLR, which requires large batch sizes, MoCo maintains a **dictionary of negative samples** that is updated gradually, enabling self-supervised training with smaller batches.

# Key Idea (one-liner)
> Build a dynamic dictionary with a momentum-updated encoder to provide consistent and abundant negative samples for contrastive learning.

# Method
- **Two encoders**:
  - **Query encoder**: updated by backprop.
  - **Key encoder**: momentum update from query encoder weights.
- **Dictionary/Queue**:
  - Stores encoded features of past samples.
  - Enqueues new keys, dequeues old ones → large, consistent set of negatives.
- **Contrastive loss (InfoNCE)**:
  - Positive = query vs matching key (same image, different augmentations).
  - Negatives = queries vs keys from queue.
- **Backbone**: ResNet (usually).
- **Batch size**: smaller than SimCLR, because negatives come from queue.

# Results
- Strong unsupervised pretraining on ImageNet.
- Linear classification accuracy close to supervised ResNet.
- Outperformed previous SSL baselines, competitive with SimCLR (at smaller compute cost).
- Scales well (MoCo v2/v3 improved further).

# Why it Mattered
- Showed contrastive learning works **without massive batch sizes**.
- Introduced **momentum encoder** + memory queue concept, widely reused in SSL.
- Provided foundation for later SSL methods (BYOL, DINO, CLIP).

# Architectural Pattern
- [[Momentum Encoder]] → stable representation learning.
- [[Memory Queue]] → large dictionary of negatives.
- [[Contrastive Loss (InfoNCE)]] → positive vs negative pairs.
- [[ResNet (2015)]] → backbone encoder.

# Connections
- **Predecessors**: Earlier instance discrimination SSL frameworks.
- **Contemporaries**: [[SimCLR (2020)]] — large-batch contrastive.
- **Successors**:
  - [[MoCo v2]] — stronger augmentations, projection head (like SimCLR).
  - [[MoCo v3]] — Transformer backbone (ViT).
- **Influence**:
  - Inspired BYOL, SwAV, DINO (all use momentum encoders/queues).
  - Core building block for contrastive multimodal models (e.g., CLIP).

# Implementation Notes
- Queue size = thousands of samples → stable negatives.
- Momentum coefficient ~0.999 → slow drift ensures consistency.
- Works on GPUs without needing TPU-scale batches.
- Pretrained weights available (ResNet-50 backbone).

# Critiques / Limitations
- Still requires careful tuning of queue size, momentum coefficient.
- Relies on negatives; contrastive-only formulation.
- Later works (BYOL, SimSiam) showed negatives aren’t strictly required.
- Sensitive to augmentation strategy.
