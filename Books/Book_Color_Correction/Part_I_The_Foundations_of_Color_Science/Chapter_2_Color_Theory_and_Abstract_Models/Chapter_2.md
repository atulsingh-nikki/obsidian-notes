### Chapter 2: Color Theory and Abstract Models
While Chapter 1 explored the scientific basis of color perception, this chapter examines the abstract frameworks and principles used by artists, designers, and technologists to organize, combine, and describe color in a practical and aesthetically effective manner.

#### 2.1 Additive vs. Subtractive Color Models
The way colors are created in the digital and physical worlds is governed by two fundamentally different processes: additive and subtractive synthesis.

*   **Additive Synthesis (RGB)**: This model applies to any medium that emits light, such as computer monitors, televisions, and projectors. It begins with a black background (the absence of light) and creates colors by adding light from primary sources. The additive primary colors are Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). When these three primary colors of light are combined in equal, full intensity, they produce white light. Varying the intensity of each primary allows for the creation of a wide spectrum of colors. This is the foundational model for all on-screen color correction.¹
*   **Subtractive Synthesis (CMY/RYB)**: This model applies to any medium that relies on reflected light, such as ink on paper or paint on canvas. It begins with a white background (which reflects all light) and creates colors by subtracting or absorbing certain wavelengths of light using pigments or dyes. The subtractive primary colors are Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow (CMY). Cyan absorbs red light, magenta absorbs green light, and yellow absorbs blue light. When all three are combined, they theoretically absorb all light and produce black. This is the basis of all color printing.²

#### 2.2 The Color Wheel: Artistic Tradition and Digital Reality
The color wheel is a visual tool that maps the relationships between colors, forming the cornerstone of color theory. However, the digital and artistic worlds rely on two different versions of this tool, a distinction that is critical for any modern practitioner to understand.

*   **The RYB Color Wheel**: Used for centuries by artists, the Red-Yellow-Blue color wheel is based on the subtractive mixing of physical pigments. Its primary colors are Red, Yellow, and Blue. Its secondary colors (created by mixing two primaries) are Orange (Red + Yellow), Green (Yellow + Blue), and Purple (Blue + Red).³
*   **The RGB Color Wheel**: Designed for digital use, the Red-Green-Blue color wheel is based on the additive mixing of light. Its primary colors are Red, Green, and Blue. Critically, its secondary colors are Cyan (Green + Blue), Magenta (Blue + Red), and Yellow (Red + Green)—the primary colors of the subtractive CMY model.⁴

This difference between the two wheels represents a historical and conceptual divide. For centuries, artists built their intuition on the subtractive RYB model. The digital revolution mandated a shift to the additive RGB model, creating a cognitive dissonance that every modern artist must overcome. For example, an artist intuitively knows that mixing red and green paint produces a muddy brown, but on a screen, mixing red and green light produces a brilliant yellow.⁴ This fundamental difference explains why educational materials and software must be explicit about which model they are using and why a deep understanding of color requires fluency in both the "language" of pigment and the "language" of light.

#### 2.3 Principles of Color Harmony
Color harmony refers to the theory of combining colors in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. These principles, derived from the color wheel, are fundamental to graphic design, user interface (UI) design, and cinematic color grading.⁵

*   **Monochromatic**: Uses variations in lightness and saturation (tints, tones, and shades) of a single hue. This creates a subtle, elegant, and harmonious look.⁴
*   **Analogous**: Uses colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel (e.g., yellow, yellow-green, and green). This scheme is often found in nature and is serene and comfortable to the eye.³
*   **Complementary**: Uses two colors that are directly opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., red and green in RYB, or red and cyan in RGB). This combination produces the highest contrast and visual energy, making elements pop.⁴
*   **Split-Complementary**: A variation of the complementary scheme. It uses a base color and the two colors adjacent to its complement. This maintains strong visual contrast but with less tension than the direct complementary scheme.³
*   **Triadic**: Uses three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel, forming an equilateral triangle. This scheme is vibrant and offers high contrast while retaining harmony.⁴
*   **Tetradic (Double Complementary)**: Uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs. This rich scheme offers the most color variety but is also the most difficult to balance. It is often best to let one color dominate and use the others as accents.⁴

#### 2.4 Defining Color Attributes
To manipulate color effectively, it is necessary to deconstruct it into its core properties.

*   **Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV/HSB)**: This is an intuitive, cylindrical color model that aligns closely with human perception.
    *   **Hue**: The pure color itself, corresponding to a location on the color wheel (e.g., red, green, blue).³
    *   **Saturation**: The intensity or purity of the color. A fully saturated color has no gray mixed in, while a desaturated color is a shade of gray.²
    *   **Value (or Brightness)**: The relative lightness or darkness of the color, ranging from black to the pure, fully illuminated hue.³
*   **Tints, Tones, and Shades**: These terms describe practical methods for modifying a pure hue:
    *   **Tint**: Created by adding white to a hue, making it lighter and often more pastel.³
    *   **Shade**: Created by adding black to a hue, making it darker and richer.³
    *   **Tone**: Created by adding gray (a mix of black and white) to a hue, reducing its intensity and making it more subtle.⁴
*   **Color Temperature**: This refers to the perceived warmth or coolness of a color. On the color wheel, colors from red through yellow are considered "warm" and are associated with energy, passion, and comfort. Colors from blue through green and violet are "cool" and are associated with calmness, stability, and serenity.³ Color temperature is a powerful tool in visual storytelling, used to set the mood of a scene or to guide the viewer's emotional response.⁵
