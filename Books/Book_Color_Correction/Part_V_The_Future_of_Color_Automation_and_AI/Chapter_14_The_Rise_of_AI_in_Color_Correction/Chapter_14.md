### Chapter 14: The Rise of AI in Color Correction
Artificial intelligence is no longer a theoretical concept in color science; it is a suite of practical tools integrated into the daily workflows of creative professionals. These tools are bifurcating into two distinct but complementary roles: the "Automated Technician," which handles tedious, rule-based tasks, and the "Creative Assistant," which provides inspiration and accelerates ideation.

#### 14.1 AI-Powered Commercial Tools in 2025
*   **Adobe Sensei**: Adobe has deeply integrated its AI and machine learning framework, Sensei, across the Creative Cloud suite. In Premiere Pro, Color Match uses AI to analyze a reference frame and automatically apply its color characteristics to other clips, with a particular focus on accurate skin tone reproduction.123 In Lightroom, AI-powered features like Denoise and intelligent Masking (e.g., automatically selecting sky, people, or even facial hair) dramatically speed up the selection and local adjustment process.125
*   **Colourlab AI**: As a leading dedicated AI grading tool, Colourlab AI (version 3.5 and beyond) offers an AI Matching Engine based on models of human perception to perform highly accurate shot balancing and matching across entire timelines with a single click.126 Its ability to function as an OFX plugin directly within DaVinci Resolve's node tree represents a seamless integration of AI into the standard professional workflow, automating the "correction" phase to free up more time for creative "grading".126
*   **NVIDIA RTX Video**: Leveraging the power of dedicated Tensor Cores on NVIDIA GPUs, the RTX Video SDK provides AI-accelerated features for video applications. A key 2025 technology is RTX Video HDR, which uses an AI model to perform real-time conversion of SDR video streams to HDR10. It intelligently expands the color gamut and dynamic range, upscaling web video or archived footage to vibrant HDR on the fly.128
*   **Other Specialized Tools**: A growing ecosystem of AI tools like Evoto AI and Topaz Video AI offer powerful features for batch processing, AI-driven upscaling, frame interpolation, and one-click application of color styles from reference images, further streamlining post-production workflows.131

#### 14.2 Deep Learning for Automated Correction (CVPR 2025)
The research frontier, as seen at the 2025 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), is pushing beyond general-purpose tools to solve highly specific and challenging correction problems using advanced deep learning architectures.

*   **Diffusion Models for Specialized Correction**: Diffusion models, which have shown state-of-the-art results in image generation, are now being adapted for targeted restoration tasks. The DiffColor model, for instance, tackles the difficult problem of underwater image enhancement. It operates in the wavelet domain to reduce computational load and uses a novel Global Color Correction (GCC) module to specifically address the severe and variable color casts caused by light absorption in water.133
*   **Generative Color Constancy (GCC)**: A groundbreaking approach to the classic white balance problem. Instead of analyzing the image for neutral tones (which may not exist), this method uses a pre-trained diffusion model to "inpaint" a virtual color checker into the scene. The model is trained to render the checker as if it were physically present under the scene's ambient illumination. The algorithm then simply analyzes the achromatic (gray) patches of this synthetically generated checker to derive a highly accurate estimate of the illuminant color and perform a precise white balance correction. This technique demonstrates remarkable robustness, especially in challenging cross-camera scenarios where sensor characteristics differ.134
